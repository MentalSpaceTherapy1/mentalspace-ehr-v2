### Can't Click Outside Modal

- **Solution:** Choose a resolution option

### No Emergency Contact Displayed
- **Cause:** Client hasn't provided emergency contact
- **Solution:** Continue with standard crisis protocol, update client record later

### Modal Won't Submit
- **Likely Cause:** Documentation too short (< 10 characters)
- **Solution:** Provide more detailed notes
