## Deployment Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: DNS Propagation Time
**Impact:** Website unavailable for up to 48 hours
**Mitigation:**
- Deploy during low-traffic period (late night/early morning)
- Notify users in advance
- Keep GoDaddy DNS backup in case of issues

### Risk 2: Email Disruption
**Impact:** Existing email may stop working
**Mitigation:**
- Using separate domain for email (`chctherapy.com`)
- Resend already verified and working
- No MX record changes needed

### Risk 3: Database Migration Issues
**Impact:** Data loss or corruption
**Mitigation:**
- Test migrations on local database first
- Take database backup before production migration
- Use Prisma's `migrate deploy` (no schema changes, only applies migrations)

### Risk 4: Backend Container Startup Failures
**Impact:** Backend service won't start
**Mitigation:**
- Test Docker build locally first
- Use AWS CloudWatch logs for debugging
- Have rollback plan (previous container version)

### Risk 5: Frontend 404 Errors (SPA routing)
**Impact:** Direct URL navigation fails
**Mitigation:**
- CloudFront custom error responses configured (404 → index.html)
- S3 bucket policy allows CloudFront access

---

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Set Up CloudWatch Alarms For:
1. **ECS Service Health**
   - Task count < 1 (service down)
   - CPU utilization > 80%
   - Memory utilization > 80%

2. **RDS Database Health**
   - CPU utilization > 80%
   - Free storage < 2 GB
   - Connection count > 80% of max

3. **ALB Health**
   - 5xx error rate > 5%
   - Target unhealthy count > 0
   - Request count spike (DDoS detection)

4. **Application Errors**
   - Error log count > 10/minute
   - Failed authentication attempts > 50/minute

### Set Up SNS Alerts
- Email: your-email@example.com
- SMS: your-phone-number (optional)

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails or critical issues occur:

### 1. DNS Rollback
```bash
# In GoDaddy DNS Management:
# 1. Change nameservers back to GoDaddy default
# 2. Wait 2-48 hours for propagation
```

### 2. Database Rollback
```bash
# Restore from RDS snapshot
aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot \
  --db-instance-identifier mentalspace-ehr-prod-restored \
  --db-snapshot-identifier snapshot-name
```

### 3. Application Rollback
```bash
# Deploy previous container version
aws ecs update-service \
  --cluster mentalspace-ehr-prod \
  --service mentalspace-backend-service \
  --task-definition mentalspace-backend-task:PREVIOUS_VERSION
```
