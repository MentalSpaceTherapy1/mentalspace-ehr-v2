## Critical Issue: Database Connectivity

###  Problem Identified

The backend API is running and passing health checks, but **cannot connect to the database** when handling authentication requests.

#### Error Messages:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Database connection failed",
  "errorId": "ERR-1760573161462-4jiddvfmg",
  "errorCode": "DATABASE_CONNECTION_ERROR"
}
```

#### From CloudWatch Logs:
```
Invalid `prisma.user.findUnique()` invocation in
/app/packages/backend/src/services/auth.service.ts:74:36
```

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Environment Variables**: The ECS task definition correctly injects database credentials as environment variables (`DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`)

2. **Database URL Construction**: The backend's [config/index.ts](packages/backend/src/config/index.ts) has a `getDatabaseUrl()` function that constructs the DATABASE_URL from these variables

3. **Prisma Client**: The issue is likely that:
   - Prisma Client may not be properly generated in the Docker container
   - OR the database connection is timing out
   - OR there's a network/security group issue preventing ECS tasks from reaching RDS

### Previous Working State

According to [DEPLOYMENT-COMPLETE-SUMMARY.md](DEPLOYMENT-COMPLETE-SUMMARY.md), database migrations were successfully run and the application was working with demo users. This suggests the database connection worked at some point.

## URLs and Access

### Frontend Application:
**Primary URL:** http://mentalspace-ehr-frontend-dev.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com

**Status:** Application loads successfully, but login will fail due to backend database issue

### Backend API:
**Primary URL:** http://mentalspace-ehr-dev-881286108.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com

**Health Endpoint:** Working
**Authentication Endpoint:** Failing (database connection error)

### Database:
**Endpoint:** `mentalspace-db-dev.ci16iwey2cac.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432`
**Database:** `mentalspace_ehr`
**Status:** Running (RDS instance is healthy)
**Network:** Private subnets only (not publicly accessible)

## Demo User Credentials (Once DB Fixed)

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Administrator | admin@mentalspace.com | SecurePass123! |
| Supervisor | supervisor@mentalspace.com | SecurePass123! |
| Clinician | clinician1@mentalspace.com | SecurePass123! |
| Billing | billing@mentalspace.com | SecurePass123! |

## Next Steps to Fix Database Connectivity

### Option 1: Verify Database Migrations

Run Prisma migrations from a location that can access the database (e.g., EC2 instance in the same VPC, or use ECS Exec):

```bash
# Using ECS Exec (if enabled)
aws ecs execute-command \
  --cluster mentalspace-ehr-dev \
  --task <task-id> \
  --container mentalspace-backend \
  --interactive \
  --command "/bin/sh"

# Then inside the container:
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..." npx prisma migrate deploy
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..." npx prisma db seed
```

### Option 2: Verify Security Group Rules

Check that the App Security Group (ECS tasks) can connect to the DB Security Group on port 5432:

```bash
# List security group rules
aws ec2 describe-security-groups \
  --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=*mentalspace*" \
  --query 'SecurityGroups[*].{Name:GroupName,ID:GroupId,Ingress:IpPermissions[*]}'
```

### Option 3: Re-generate Prisma Client in Docker

The Dockerfile might need to ensure Prisma Client is properly generated. Verify [packages/backend/Dockerfile](packages/backend/Dockerfile) includes:

```dockerfile
RUN npx prisma generate --schema=packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma
```

### Option 4: Add DATABASE_URL as Secret

Instead of constructing DATABASE_URL from individual fields, add it directly as a secret in the ECS task definition:

1. Create a new secret in Secrets Manager with the full DATABASE_URL
2. Update [infrastructure/lib/compute-stack.ts](infrastructure/lib/compute-stack.ts) to inject it
3. Redeploy the Compute stack

## Infrastructure Summary

### Deployed AWS Resources:

1. **Network Stack** (VPC, Subnets, NAT Gateways, Security Groups)
2. **Security Stack** (KMS, Secrets Manager, IAM Roles)
3. **Database Stack** (RDS PostgreSQL, DynamoDB Tables)
4. **ALB Stack** (Application Load Balancer, Target Group, WAF)
5. **ECR Stack** (Container Registry)
6. **Compute Stack** (ECS Fargate Cluster and Service)
7. **Frontend** (S3 Static Website Hosting)

### Not Yet Deployed:

8. **Monitoring Stack** - CloudWatch Dashboards and Alarms (optional)
9. **Frontend Stack (CDK)** - CloudFront distribution (optional, S3 works)

---

## Monthly Cost Estimate

**Current:** ~$62/month

- NAT Gateway: $32.40/month
- RDS t3.micro: $12.24/month
- ALB: $16.20/month
- ECS Fargate (1 task): $2.88/month
- S3 Storage: <$1/month
- Data Transfer: Variable

---

## Testing the Frontend

### 1. Access the Application:
Open http://mentalspace-ehr-frontend-dev.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com in your browser

### 2. Expected Behavior:
- Login page loads
- React application initializes
- API requests are sent to the backend ALB

### 3. Current Limitation:
- Login will fail with "Database connection failed" error
- Once database connectivity is fixed, authentication should work

---

## Files Modified in This Deployment

### Frontend:
- `packages/frontend/.env.production` - Added API URL
- `packages/frontend/dist/*` - Production build output
- `packages/frontend/src/lib/api.ts` - Created API client
- `packages/frontend/src/types/index.ts` - Created TypeScript types
- `packages/frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx` - Updated to use API client
- `packages/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Updated to use API client

### Infrastructure:
- Created S3 bucket `mentalspace-ehr-frontend-dev`
- Configured static website hosting
- Enabled public read access

---

## Recommendation

**Priority:** Fix database connectivity issue in backend before continuing with additional features.

**Immediate Action Items:**
1. Verify Prisma Client is generated in Docker container
2. Check security group rules between ECS and RDS
3. Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable is correctly constructed
4. Test database connection from within ECS task using ECS Exec
5. Run database migrations if needed

**Once Database Fixed:**
1. Test end-to-end login flow
2. Verify all API endpoints work correctly
3. Complete remaining frontend API integrations
4. Add CloudFront distribution (optional, for HTTPS and better performance)
5. Set up custom domain with Route 53 and ACM certificate

## Success Metrics

 Frontend deployed and accessible via S3 static website hosting
 Backend API running and healthy
 Load balancer routing traffic correctly
 All infrastructure created and operational
 Database connectivity issue - needs resolution
 End-to-end authentication - blocked by database issue
