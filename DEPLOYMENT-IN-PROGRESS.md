## üìä What's Being Created

### Networking (Stack 1)
- ‚úÖ VPC with 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR
- ‚úÖ 3 Availability Zones (us-east-1a, 1b, 1c)
- ‚úÖ 3 Public subnets (for load balancers)
- ‚úÖ 3 Private subnets (for application servers)
- ‚úÖ 3 Isolated subnets (for databases)
- ‚úÖ 1 NAT Gateway (dev cost optimization)
- ‚úÖ VPC Flow Logs for security monitoring
- ‚úÖ Security Groups (Bastion, ALB, App, Database)

### Security (Stack 2)
- KMS encryption key for data at rest
- AWS Secrets Manager for database credentials
- IAM roles and policies

### Database (Stack 3)
- RDS PostgreSQL 16.6 (t3.micro for dev)
- Publicly accessible for initial setup
- Automated backups (7 days retention)
- Encryption at rest with KMS
- DynamoDB tables for sessions and cache

### Load Balancer (Stack 4)
- Application Load Balancer
- HTTP listener on port 80
- WAF with 5 security rules:
  - Rate limiting (2000 requests per 5 min)
  - SQL injection protection
  - XSS protection
  - Known bad inputs blocking
  - Missing User-Agent blocking

### Compute (Stack 5)
- ECS Fargate cluster
- ECR repository for Docker images
- Auto-scaling configuration (1 task min)
- CloudWatch log groups

### Monitoring (Stack 6)
- CloudWatch Dashboard
- CPU utilization alarms
- Storage space alarms
- Connection count alarms
- SNS topic for alerts

## üí∞ Infrastructure Cost

**Development Environment:**
- RDS t3.micro: ~$25/month
- NAT Gateway: ~$35/month
- ALB: ~$25/month
- ECS Fargate (1 task): ~$15/month
- DynamoDB: ~$5/month
- CloudWatch: ~$10/month
- **Total: ~$115/month**

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline

- **0-5 minutes:** Network stack creation (VPC, subnets, NAT)
- **5-10 minutes:** Security stack creation (KMS, Secrets Manager)
- **10-20 minutes:** Database stack creation (RDS - this is the slowest)
- **20-25 minutes:** ALB stack creation
- **25-28 minutes:** Compute stack creation
- **28-30 minutes:** Monitoring stack creation

---

## üéØ What Happens Next (Automatically)

After all stacks deploy successfully:

1. I'll retrieve the ECR repository URL
2. I'll build your Docker image from the backend code
3. I'll push the image to ECR
4. I'll get the database credentials from Secrets Manager
5. I'll run Prisma migrations to set up your database
6. I'll force ECS to deploy the new image
7. I'll verify the health endpoint responds

**Total additional time:** ~15-20 minutes

---

## üìã You Don't Need to Do Anything!

I'm handling:
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure deployment
- ‚úÖ Docker image building
- ‚úÖ Image pushing to ECR
- ‚úÖ Database migrations
- ‚úÖ Service deployment
- ‚úÖ Health check verification

**Just sit back and relax! ‚òï**

## üîî I'll Let You Know When:

1. Network stack completes (5 mins)
2. Database is created (20 mins)
3. All infrastructure is deployed (30 mins)
4. Application is running and healthy (50 mins total)

**Status will be updated as deployment progresses...**
