# Deployment Progress Update - October 15, 2025 (3:35 PM)

## Current Status: 95% Complete - Final Issue

### ‚úÖ Successfully Completed

1. **Fixed Docker Image Configuration**
   - Modified backend config to construct DATABASE_URL from individual environment variables
   - Updated Compute stack to map database secret fields correctly (DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME)
   - Added JWT_SECRET and other required environment variables
   - Docker image rebuilds and pushes successfully

2. **ECS Task Now Starts Successfully**
   - Previous error: "retrieved secret from Secrets Manager did not contain json key DATABASE_URL"
   - **FIXED:** Tasks can now pull secrets and start containers
   - Container starts and runs the application

### üöß Current Blocker: Container Exits Immediately

**Problem:**
The ECS container starts successfully but then exits with code 0 (normal exit). This triggers the deployment circuit breaker because ECS expects the web server to keep running.

**What's Happening:**
1. ‚úÖ Container pulls from ECR successfully
2. ‚úÖ Container starts with correct environment variables and secrets
3. ‚úÖ Application code begins execution
4. ‚ùå Application exits immediately (exit code 0)
5. ‚ùå ECS deployment circuit breaker triggers after multiple failed attempts

**Most Likely Causes:**
1. **Database Connection Failure** - Application can't connect to RDS PostgreSQL
   - Network security group rules may be blocking connection
   - Database might not be accepting connections yet
   - Wrong DATABASE_URL construction

2. **Missing Prisma Migrations** - Database schema not initialized
   - Tables don't exist yet in the database
   - Application crashes on first database query

3. **Application Startup Error** - Code issue causing immediate exit

### üìä What I Need to Diagnose

I need to see the CloudWatch Logs from the failed container to understand why it's exiting. However, the current IAM user doesn't have permission to read CloudWatch Logs.

**Log Group Name:** `/ecs/mentalspace-ehr-dev`

### üîß Two Options to Fix

#### Option 1: Grant CloudWatch Logs Permissions (Recommended)

Add this policy to the `mentalspace-chime-sdk` IAM user:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
        "logs:DescribeLogStreams",
        "logs:FilterLogEvents",
        "logs:GetLogEvents",
        "logs:Tail"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:706704660887:log-group:/ecs/mentalspace-ehr-dev:*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**How to apply:**
1. Go to AWS IAM Console ‚Üí Users ‚Üí `mentalspace-chime-sdk`
2. Click "Add permissions" ‚Üí "Create inline policy"
3. Paste the JSON above
4. Name it `CloudWatchLogsRead`
5. Save

Once permissions are granted, I can:
- Read the container logs
- Identify the exact error
- Fix the issue
- Redeploy successfully

#### Option 2: Manual Log Retrieval

If you prefer not to grant permissions, you can:
1. Go to AWS CloudWatch Console
2. Navigate to Log Groups ‚Üí `/ecs/mentalspace-ehr-dev`
3. Find the most recent log stream
4. Copy the last 50-100 lines of logs
5. Provide them to me

### üìà Infrastructure Status

**Currently Running (costing money):**
- NAT Gateway: $0.045/hour
- RDS PostgreSQL (t3.micro): $0.017/hour
- Application Load Balancer: $0.0225/hour
- **Total: $0.0845/hour** (~$62/month)

**Not Running Yet:**
- ECS Fargate tasks (deployment keeps failing and rolling back)
- So compute costs are still $0

### üéØ What's Left

Once I can see the logs and fix the container exit issue:
1. Fix the root cause (likely database connection or Prisma migrations)
2. Rebuild and push updated Docker image (~3 minutes)
3. Redeploy Compute stack (~5 minutes)
4. Run Prisma database migrations (~1 minute)
5. Deploy Monitoring stack (~2 minutes)
6. Verify application is accessible via load balancer

**Estimated time after log access: 10-15 minutes**

## Technical Details

### Files Modified in This Session

1. **packages/backend/src/config/index.ts**
   - Added `getDatabaseUrl()` function to construct DATABASE_URL from individual DB_ environment variables
   - Enables flexible configuration for both local development and ECS deployment

2. **infrastructure/lib/compute-stack.ts**
   - Changed secrets mapping from DATABASE_URL to individual fields (DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD)
   - Added JWT_SECRET, AWS_REGION, and DYNAMODB_SESSIONS_TABLE environment variables
   - Maps RDS secret fields correctly for ECS tasks

### Infrastructure Resources Created

- **ECS Cluster:** `mentalspace-ehr-dev`
- **CloudWatch Log Group:** `/ecs/mentalspace-ehr-dev`
- **Task Definition:** With correct secret mappings and environment variables
- **IAM Roles:** TaskExecutionRole (with Secrets Manager access) and TaskRole (with AWS service permissions)

### Docker Image

- **Location:** `706704660887.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/mentalspace-ehr-backend-dev:latest`
- **Digest:** `sha256:454bb2b5a7de99e18092bed0ccba9b5cb06bdac538b3b1c4edea4e38fe89e769`
- **Status:** Successfully built and pushed with updated configuration

**Last Updated:** October 15, 2025 at 3:35 PM
**Next Action:** Waiting for CloudWatch Logs access to diagnose container exit issue
