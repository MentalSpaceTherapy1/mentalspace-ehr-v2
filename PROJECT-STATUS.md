## 🚧 IN PROGRESS

### Infrastructure Deployment
- [ ] **READY TO DEPLOY** - Deploy Network Stack (~5-10 minutes)
- [ ] **WAITING** - Deploy Security Stack (~2-3 minutes)
- [ ] **WAITING** - Deploy Database Stack (~15-20 minutes for RDS)

**Total estimated deployment time:** ~25-35 minutes

---

## 📋 NEXT STEPS (Immediate)

### Step 1: Deploy Infrastructure (TODAY)
```bash
cd C:\Users\Elize\mentalspace-ehr-v2\infrastructure
cdk deploy --all
```

**What this will create:**
1. **VPC** with 3 AZs, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups
2. **KMS Key** for encryption
3. **Secrets Manager** secrets (DB credentials, JWT, Session)
4. **RDS PostgreSQL** database instance
5. **DynamoDB** tables for sessions and cache

**Estimated Cost:** ~$15-20 for first month (dev environment)

### Step 2: Get External API Keys (WHEN NEEDED)
You'll need these API keys later. I'll let you know when:

1. **OpenAI API Key** - https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Needed for: AI clinical note generation
   - Cost: ~$20-50/month (usage-based)

2. **Anthropic API Key** - https://console.anthropic.com
   - Needed for: Billing analytics, therapist assistant
   - Cost: ~$20-50/month (usage-based)

3. **Stripe** - https://stripe.com
   - Needed for: Payment processing
   - Cost: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction

4. **Twilio** - https://twilio.com
   - Needed for: SMS notifications
   - Cost: ~$0.0079 per SMS

5. **SendGrid** - https://sendgrid.com
   - Needed for: Email delivery
   - Cost: Free tier (100 emails/day) or $19.95/month

**You don't need these yet** - I'll prompt you when we're ready to integrate them.

### Step 3: Initialize Database Schema (AFTER STEP 1)
Once infrastructure is deployed:
1. Create Prisma schema with all tables
2. Run database migrations
3. Seed test data

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA (Phase 1)

Phase 1 is complete when:
- [ ] All infrastructure deployed successfully
- [ ] Database is accessible and populated with schema
- [ ] Can authenticate users (login/register)
- [ ] Can create/read/update/delete users via API
- [ ] Basic frontend shows dashboard after login
- [ ] All endpoints tested with Postman
- [ ] Code is in Git with proper commits

**Expected Completion:** ~1-2 weeks from now

---

## 🔐 SECURITY STATUS

- [x] KMS encryption configured
- [x] Secrets Manager for credentials
- [x] VPC isolation
- [x] Security Groups configured
- [x] VPC Flow Logs enabled
- [ ] CloudTrail (will enable with monitoring)
- [ ] WAF (will configure with ALB)
- [ ] IAM roles (will create with Lambda functions)

---

## 🚨 BLOCKERS & RISKS

### Current Blockers
**None** - Ready to proceed with deployment!

### Risks
1. **AWS Costs** - Monitor billing alerts
   - Mitigation: Set up billing alarms, use t3.micro instances for dev

2. **RDS Deployment Time** - Can take 15-20 minutes
   - Mitigation: Be patient, it's normal

3. **API Key Costs** - OpenAI/Anthropic can get expensive
   - Mitigation: Set usage limits, we'll optimize prompts

---

## 📞 NEXT INTERACTION POINTS

### When I'll Ask for API Keys:

1. **OpenAI API Key** - When we build the AI clinical notes feature (Phase 4, Week 5-6)
2. **Anthropic API Key** - When we build billing analytics (Phase 9)
3. **Stripe Keys** - When we build payment processing (Phase 7-8)
4. **Twilio** - When we build SMS reminders (Phase 3)
5. **SendGrid** - When we build email notifications (Phase 3)

**For now, you don't need any external API keys!**

**Ready for the next step?** Deploy the infrastructure with:
```bash
cd C:\Users\Elize\mentalspace-ehr-v2\infrastructure
cdk deploy --all
```

This will take ~25-35 minutes. I'll monitor the deployment and let you know when it's done!
