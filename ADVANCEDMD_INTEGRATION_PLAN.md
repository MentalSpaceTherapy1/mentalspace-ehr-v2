# AdvancedMD Integration Plan
**Timeline:** Within 1 week
**Status:** Ready for Implementation
**Last Updated:** January 2025

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the complete integration plan for AdvancedMD API, including authentication, rate limiting, patient sync, eligibility checks, claim submission, and payment posting. The billing module has been architected to fully support AdvancedMD integration based on their API capabilities and limitations.

---

## Key Integration Facts

### Authentication
- **Token Expiration:** 24 hours (rotating every 23 hours to avoid expiration)
- **Credentials Required:**
  - Office Key (Practice ID)
  - API Username/Password
  - Client ID / Client Secret
  - Separate credentials for Sandbox vs. Production

### API Rate Limits

#### Peak Hours
- **Definition:** 6:00 AM - 6:00 PM Mountain Time, Monday-Friday
- **Impact:** Significantly reduced rate limits during peak hours

#### Tier 1 - High Impact Calls
- **Endpoints:** `GETUPDATEDVISITS`, `GETUPDATEDPATIENTS`
- **Peak Hours:** 1 call/minute (60 calls/hour)
- **Off-Peak:** 60 calls/minute (3,600 calls/hour)
- **Strategy:** Use sparingly, batch sync during off-peak hours

#### Tier 2 - Medium Impact Calls
- **Endpoints:** `SAVECHARGES`, `GETDEMOGRAPHIC`, `GETDATEVISITS`, `UPDVISITWITHNEWCHARGES`, `GETTXHISTORY`, `GETAPPTS`, `GETPAYMENTDETAILDATA`
- **Peak Hours:** 12 calls/minute (720 calls/hour)
- **Off-Peak:** 120 calls/minute (7,200 calls/hour)

#### Tier 3 - Low Impact Calls
- **Endpoints:** All `LOOKUP` APIs (CPT, ICD-10, Payers, etc.)
- **Peak Hours:** 24 calls/minute (1,440 calls/hour)
- **Off-Peak:** 120 calls/minute (7,200 calls/hour)

### Eligibility Checks
- **Real-Time:** Yes
- **Response Time:** <30 seconds
- **Success Rate:** 99.9%
- **Cost:** No per-query cost
- **Clearinghouse:** Waystar (direct connections to all major payers)
- **Caching:** Cache results for 24 hours to reduce API calls

### Claims Management
- **Submission:** Electronic via API (837P format)
- **Batch Support:** Yes (batch size TBD, estimated 100-500)
- **Acceptance Rate:** 99.5% guaranteed
- **Clearinghouse:** Waystar or Change
- **Claim Resubmission:** Supported via API (resend charge to existing visit voids previous)
- **Claim Attachments:** Supported in UI, not via API

### Payment Posting
- **API Support:** Yes, can post payments via API
- **Payment Application:** Manual application via UI (not via API)
- **ERA Retrieval:** Not available via API (UI only)
- **Auto-Posting:** Can post payments, but cannot auto-apply to specific charges via API

### Webhooks
- **Support:** No webhooks available
- **Workaround:** Polling for updates (use Tier 1 calls sparingly)

### Reporting
- **Via API:** Limited
- **Via UI:** Comprehensive reporting available
- **Via ODBC:** Yes, for data export and custom reporting
- **Date Range:** Up to 24 months

- Show last check date and cache status

**Database Changes:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE "EligibilityCheck" (
  "id" TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  "clientId" TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES "Client"("id"),
  "insuranceId" TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES "Insurance"("id"),
  "checkDate" TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  "responseData" JSONB NOT NULL,
  "coverageActive" BOOLEAN,
  "copay" DECIMAL(10,2),
  "deductible" DECIMAL(10,2),
  "deductibleMet" DECIMAL(10,2),
  "cachedUntil" TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT "fk_eligibility_client" FOREIGN KEY ("clientId") REFERENCES "Client"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### Phase 4: Charge Submission (Days 4-5)
- [ ] Map charges from our system to AdvancedMD format

- [ ] Handle charge updates (void + resubmit logic)
- [ ] Test with various CPT codes
- [ ] Implement batch charge submission
- [ ] Error handling and validation

**API Endpoints Used:**

**Workflow:**
1. User creates charge in our system
2. Validate charge data (CPT, diagnosis, units)
3. Submit to AdvancedMD via API
4. Store AdvancedMD charge ID
5. Poll for acceptance status

**Database Changes:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE "ChargeEntry" ADD COLUMN "advancedMDChargeId" TEXT;
ALTER TABLE "ChargeEntry" ADD COLUMN "advancedMDVisitId" TEXT;
ALTER TABLE "ChargeEntry" ADD COLUMN "syncStatus" TEXT DEFAULT 'pending';
ALTER TABLE "ChargeEntry" ADD COLUMN "syncError" TEXT;

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Rate limiter logic
- Token refresh mechanism
- Data mappers
- Error handling

### Integration Tests
- API authentication
- Patient create/update
- Eligibility checks
- Charge submission
- Claim submission
- Payment posting

### End-to-End Tests
1. Create patient in our system â†’ Sync to AdvancedMD â†’ Verify
2. Check eligibility â†’ Cache â†’ Re-check â†’ Use cache
3. Create charge â†’ Submit to AdvancedMD â†’ Verify
4. Generate claim â†’ Submit â†’ Track status â†’ Verify
5. Post payment â†’ Verify in AdvancedMD

### Load Tests
- Test rate limiting under high load
- Verify queue behavior when limits exceeded
- Test peak vs. off-peak performance

---

## Monitoring & Alerts

### CloudWatch Metrics
- AdvancedMD API call count (by endpoint, by tier)
- AdvancedMD API latency (p50, p95, p99)
- AdvancedMD API errors (by type)
- Rate limit hits (how often we hit limits)
- Token refresh success/failure

### Alerts
- **Critical:** Token refresh failure
- **Critical:** API authentication failure
- **High:** Rate limit exceeded for >10 minutes
- **High:** API error rate >5%
- **Medium:** Slow API response time (>10s)

### Dashboards
- Real-time API call volume
- Rate limit utilization (by tier)
- Sync status (patients, visits, claims)
- Eligibility check success rate
- Claim acceptance rate

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Rate Limits During Peak Hours
**Mitigation:**
- Schedule Tier 1 syncs during off-peak only
- Implement intelligent queueing
- Show user-friendly messages when rate limited
- Cache eligibility checks for 24 hours

### Risk 2: Token Expiration
**Mitigation:**
- Automatic refresh every 23 hours
- Retry with new token on 401 errors
- Monitor token refresh failures

### Risk 3: API Downtime
**Mitigation:**
- Implement exponential backoff retry
- Queue failed operations for retry
- Show status page to users
- Manual fallback processes documented

### Risk 4: Data Sync Conflicts
**Mitigation:**
- Store AdvancedMD IDs in our database
- Implement conflict resolution logic
- Manual reconciliation UI
- Audit log all sync operations

### Risk 5: Duplicate Patients
**Mitigation:**
- Search before create
- Fuzzy matching on name + DOB
- Manual merge tool
- Flag potential duplicates for review
