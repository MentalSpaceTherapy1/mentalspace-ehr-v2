   - 95% of revenue depends on this
   - Cannot launch without it
   - Start immediately

2. **Test Coverage** (Weeks 1-10, ongoing)
   - Currently 5%, need 80%
   - Write tests as you build features
   - Integration tests critical

3. **MFA** (Weeks 7-8)
   - HIPAA requirement for admins
   - Relatively quick to implement
   - Can run parallel with other work

4. **Security Audit** (Week 9)
   - Schedule third-party vendor NOW
   - 2-3 week lead time typical
   - Critical for compliance certification

5. **Production Environment** (Week 11)
   - Deploy all infrastructure to prod
   - Test backups and disaster recovery
   - Blue-green deployment

6. **Claims Processing** (Weeks 7-8)
   - Revenue optimization
   - Can launch without but limits billing
   - AdvancedMD integration important

## üí° Pro Tips for Success

### For Telehealth Implementation:

1. **Start Simple**
   - Get basic video working first
   - Add features incrementally
   - Don't try to build everything at once

2. **Test Early, Test Often**
   - Test with real devices (phones, tablets)
   - Test various network conditions
   - Test screen sharing

3. **Plan for Failure**
   - Network drops are common
   - Implement reconnection logic
   - Show clear error messages

4. **User Experience Matters**
   - Simple, intuitive controls
   - Clear visual feedback
   - Minimal clicks to join session

### For Infrastructure Deployment:

1. **Deploy Staging First**
   - Catch issues early
   - Perfect your process
   - Document any problems

2. **Monitor Everything**
   - Watch CloudWatch closely
   - Set up Slack/email alerts
   - Check logs regularly

3. **Backup Before Changes**
   - Take RDS snapshot
   - Tag resources properly
   - Document current state

4. **Test Rollback**
   - Practice rolling back
   - Time how long it takes
   - Document the procedure

## üéØ Decision Point: What's Your Priority?

### Scenario 1: Deploy First, Then Build
**Best If:** You have 1 developer or want to validate infrastructure

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Deploy & test infrastructure
- Week 2-5: Build telehealth
- Week 6-12: Testing, MFA, claims, launch

### Scenario 2: Build First, Deploy Later
**Best If:** Infrastructure can wait, telehealth is urgent

**Timeline:**
- Week 1-4: Build telehealth (test locally)
- Week 5: Deploy infrastructure
- Week 6-12: Testing, MFA, claims, launch

### Scenario 3: Parallel (Recommended)
**Best If:** You have 2+ developers

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Deploy infrastructure AND start telehealth
- Week 2-4: Continue telehealth while testing deployed infra
- Week 5-12: Testing, MFA, claims, launch
