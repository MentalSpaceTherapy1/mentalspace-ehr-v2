# Systematic Fixes for 3 Remaining Issues

## Issue #1: CPT Codes Migration  ✅ IN PROGRESS

### Current Status
- **Local Database**: 19 CPT codes exist
- **Production Database**: Only 4 basic codes were created

### What Needs to Be Done
Migrate all 19 existing CPT codes from local to production.

### Codes to Migrate
1. 90785 - Interactive complexity (add-on code)
2. 90791 - Psychiatric diagnostic evaluation without medical services
3. 90792 - Psychiatric diagnostic evaluation with medical services
4. 90832 - Psychotherapy, 30 minutes
5. 90833 - Psychotherapy, 30 minutes with E/M service
6. 90834 - Psychotherapy, 45 minutes
7. 90836 - Psychotherapy, 45 minutes with E/M service
8. 90837 - Psychotherapy, 60 minutes
9. 90838 - Psychotherapy, 60 minutes with E/M service
10. 90839 - Psychotherapy for crisis; first 60 minutes
11. 90840 - Psychotherapy for crisis; each additional 30 minutes
12. 90846 - Family psychotherapy (without patient)
13. 90847 - Family psychotherapy (with patient)
14. 90853 - Group psychotherapy
15. 96130 - Psychological testing evaluation, first hour
16. 96131 - Psychological testing evaluation, each additional hour
17. 99212 - Office visit E/M (10-19 minutes)
18. 99213 - Office visit E/M (20-29 minutes)
19. 99214 - Office visit E/M (30-39 minutes)

### Files Created
- `check-local-cpt-codes.js` - Exports local CPT codes
- `local-cpt-codes.json` - JSON export of all 19 codes
- `migrate-all-cpt-codes.js` - Migration script (needs to run on production)

### Action Required
Run the migration script via ECS task to load all 19 codes into production database.

## Issue #2: Google Maps Autocomplete ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

### Current Status
- **API Key**: Added to `.env.production` ✅
- **Integration**: NOT implemented in the code ❌

### Root Cause
The Google Maps API key was added to environment variables, but NO Google Maps autocomplete component or integration was ever built. The address fields in `ClientForm.tsx` are just plain text inputs (lines 502-510 and beyond).

### What Needs to Be Done

#### Step 1: Add Google Maps Script to index.html
Load Google Maps JavaScript API with Places library.

#### Step 2: Create AddressAutocomplete Component
Build a reusable React component that:
- Uses Google Places Autocomplete API
- Handles address selection
- Auto-fills street, city, state, zip fields

#### Step 3: Integrate into ClientForm
Replace the plain text address input with the autocomplete component.

#### Step 4: Test
Verify autocomplete works when typing addresses.

### Similar Implementations Needed
- Practice Settings form (if it has address fields)
- Any other forms with address inputs

## Issue #3: Telehealth Session - Camera & UI Not Loading ❌ NOT INVESTIGATED YET

### Current Status
- **Symptom**: When clicking "Join Session", camera doesn't activate and UI doesn't load
- **Root Cause**: Unknown - needs investigation

### What Needs to Be Done

#### Step 1: Check Telehealth Route
Verify the route exists and is properly configured.

#### Step 2: Check TelehealthSession Component
Examine the component at `packages/frontend/src/pages/Telehealth/TelehealthSession.tsx`

#### Step 3: Check Video Integration
- Is Twilio Video configured correctly?
- Are environment variables set for Twilio?
- Is the backend endpoint working?

#### Step 4: Check Browser Permissions
- Camera/microphone permissions
- HTTPS requirement for getUserMedia

#### Step 5: Check Console Errors
What JavaScript errors appear in browser console when clicking "Join Session"?

### Files to Investigate
- `packages/frontend/src/pages/Telehealth/TelehealthSession.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/src/pages/Telehealth/VideoSession.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/src/components/Telehealth/VideoControls.tsx`
- Backend API endpoint for telehealth sessions
