# Phase 1.4 Deployment In Progress

**Status**: GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Running
**Time**: October 22, 2025 at 10:12 PM
**Commits Deployed**:
- `9fdee5e` - fix: Correct API URL paths in SignatureSettings component
- `8c3d4a3` - fix: Use authenticated API client in SignatureSettings
- `cc741e6` - chore: trigger backend deployment for Phase 1.4

## Deployment Timeline

### ‚úÖ Completed Steps

1. **Frontend Deployment** (10:00 PM - 10:05 PM)
   - Fixed API URL paths (removed double `/api/v1/api/v1/`)
   - Fixed authentication (switched from `axios` to `api` client)
   - Built and deployed to S3: `index-8cTo6-_H.js`
   - CloudFront cache invalidated
   - **Status**: LIVE at https://mentalspaceehr.com/profile

2. **Database Migration** (01:40 AM - 01:50 AM)
   - Applied Phase 1.4 migration via ECS task
   - Created tables: `signature_attestations`, `signature_events`
   - Added user fields: `signaturePin`, `signaturePassword`, `signatureBiometric`
   - Seeded 4 default attestations (GA, FL, US jurisdictions)
   - **Status**: COMPLETE (exit code 0)

3. **Backend Code Push** (10:11 PM)
   - Pushed Phase 1.4 backend code to GitHub
   - Triggered CI/CD workflow
   - **Status**: GitHub Actions workflow running

### üîÑ In Progress

4. **Backend Deployment** (Estimated 10-20 minutes)
   - GitHub Actions building fresh Docker image WITHOUT cache
   - Will include Phase 1.4 user signature routes:
     - `POST /api/v1/users/signature-pin`
     - `POST /api/v1/users/signature-password`
     - `GET /api/v1/users/signature-status`
   - Pushing to ECR with git commit SHA tag
   - Deploying to ECS Fargate
   - Waiting for service stabilization
   - Health checks and smoke tests
   - **Expected ETA**: 10:25 PM - 10:30 PM

### ‚è≥ Pending

5. **End-to-End Verification**
   - Test signature PIN setup at https://mentalspaceehr.com/profile
   - Verify signature password setup
   - Check signature status API
   - Confirm database records created

6. **Phase 1.5 Implementation**
   - Signature Capture UI components
   - PIN/Password authentication dialogs
   - Signature canvas integration

7. **Phase 1.6 Implementation**
   - Sign clinical notes workflow
   - Attestation display and confirmation
   - Signature event logging
   - Note locking after signature

## Technical Details

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue was NOT with the frontend (authentication is now fixed). The problem was:

1. **Old Docker Image in Production**
   - Current image digest: `sha256:8f4645dd...`
   - Built on October 22 at 4:30 PM
   - BEFORE Phase 1.4 user routes were added

2. **Docker Cache Confusion**
   - Local Docker builds used cached layers
   - New builds created SAME digest as old image
   - Phase 1.4 routes existed in local code but not in deployed image

3. **Solution**
   - Use GitHub Actions to build FRESH image in clean environment
   - No cached layers - guaranteed to include latest code
   - Deploy via automated CI/CD pipeline

### What's Deploying Now

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml`) is:

1. **Building** Docker image on Ubuntu runner (clean environment)
2. **Tagging** with git commit SHA: `cc741e6`
3. **Pushing** to ECR: `706704660887.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/mentalspace-backend:cc741e6`
4. **Creating** new ECS task definition with health checks
5. **Deploying** to ECS cluster `mentalspace-ehr-prod`
6. **Waiting** for service to stabilize (up to 15 minutes)
7. **Running** smoke tests to verify deployment

### Expected Outcome

Once deployed, the backend will have:
- ‚úÖ Signature authentication routes in `user.routes.ts`
- ‚úÖ Signature controller with PIN/password logic
- ‚úÖ Signature service with database operations
- ‚úÖ Integration with signature_attestations and signature_events tables

The frontend at https://mentalspaceehr.com/profile will be able to:
- ‚úÖ Fetch signature status (`GET /users/signature-status`)
- ‚úÖ Set up PIN authentication (`POST /users/signature-pin`)
- ‚úÖ Set up password authentication (`POST /users/signature-password`)

## Monitoring

To monitor the deployment:

1. **GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/MentalSpaceTherapy1/mentalspace-ehr-v2/actions
2. **AWS ECS Console**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-1#/clusters/mentalspace-ehr-prod/services/mentalspace-backend
3. **Backend Health**: https://api.mentalspaceehr.com/api/v1/health
4. **Backend Version**: https://api.mentalspaceehr.com/api/v1/version

## Next Actions (When Deployment Completes)

1. Wait for GitHub Actions workflow to complete (~15-20 minutes)
2. Verify backend health check returns 200 OK
3. Test signature endpoints:
   ```bash
   curl https://api.mentalspaceehr.com/api/v1/users/signature-status \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
   ```
4. Test from frontend: Login ‚Üí My Profile ‚Üí Set PIN (1234)
5. If successful, proceed to Phase 1.5 and 1.6 implementation
