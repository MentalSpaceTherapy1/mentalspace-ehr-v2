**Completion:** 95% (Core functionality ready for testing)

---

## 📋 Overview

The Supervision module (Phase 5) has been successfully implemented, transforming it from **40% complete** (database only) to **95% complete** (full-stack implementation). This module is critical for mental health practices with associates, trainees, and supervisees working toward licensure.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Backend API Routes** (`supervision.routes.ts`)

Created a comprehensive API with 11 endpoints:

#### Supervision Sessions
- `GET /api/v1/supervision/sessions` - Get all supervision sessions (role-filtered)
- `GET /api/v1/supervision/sessions/:id` - Get specific session details
- `POST /api/v1/supervision/sessions` - Create new session (auto-creates hours log)
- `PUT /api/v1/supervision/sessions/:id` - Update session

#### Supervision Hours Tracking
- `GET /api/v1/supervision/hours/:superviseeId` - Get hours summary for supervisee
- `GET /api/v1/supervision/hours` - Get all hours logs (role-filtered)
- `POST /api/v1/supervision/hours` - Create hours log entry
- `PUT /api/v1/supervision/hours/:id/verify` - Verify hours (supervisor only)

#### Co-Signing Workflow
- `GET /api/v1/supervision/cosign-queue` - Get notes pending co-signature
- `POST /api/v1/supervision/cosign/:noteId` - Co-sign or request revisions
- `GET /api/v1/supervision/supervisees` - Get all supervisees for current supervisor

**Key Features:**
- Role-based access control (Administrators see all, Supervisors see their supervisees, Supervisees see their own)
- Automatic hours log creation when documenting sessions
- Automatic update of supervisee's `completedSupervisionHours`
- Support for revisions workflow (supervisor can send notes back for edits)
