## 🎯 What Happens Next

After all stacks complete (~20 more minutes), I will automatically:

1. **Build Docker Image** (5 minutes)
   - Create production container from your backend code
   - Optimize image size
   - Tag with latest

2. **Push to ECR** (2 minutes)
   - Login to AWS ECR
   - Push image to repository
   - Verify upload

3. **Database Setup** (3 minutes)
   - Get credentials from Secrets Manager
   - Run Prisma migrations
   - Create all tables

4. **Deploy Application** (2 minutes)
   - Force ECS service update
   - Deploy new container
   - Wait for health checks

5. **Verification** (1 minute)
   - Test health endpoint
   - Verify database connection
   - Check logs

**Total Additional Time:** ~15 minutes
**Your Application Running:** ~2:55 PM + 15 min = **3:10 PM**
