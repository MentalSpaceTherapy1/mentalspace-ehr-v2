# Appointment-Based Clinical Notes - Implementation Status

## CRITICAL FIX COMPLETED

### Problem Resolved: Notes Not Displaying
**Issue**: Clinical notes were being saved successfully (HTTP 201) but not appearing in the UI
**Root Cause**: Each controller creating its own PrismaClient, causing undefined database models
**Solution**: Created shared Prisma singleton at `packages/backend/src/lib/prisma.ts`
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### What This Means
Your previously saved clinical notes (2 Intake Assessments for Jessica Anderson) ARE in the database and will now be visible when you refresh the page.

## BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION - COMPLETE ✅

### 1. Appointment Eligibility Service
**File**: `packages/backend/src/services/appointment-eligibility.service.ts`

Maps note types to eligible appointments:
- **Intake Assessment** → Intake appointments (90791)
- **Progress Note** → Therapy sessions (90832/90834/90837)
- **Treatment Plan** → Treatment planning appointments
- All 8 note types supported

Features:
- Prevents duplicate notes per appointment
- Filters by status, date, and existing notes
- Returns default config for creating new appointments

### 2. Diagnosis Inheritance Service  
**File**: `packages/backend/src/services/diagnosis-inheritance.service.ts`

- Auto-populates diagnoses from latest signed Intake
- Applies to Progress Notes and Treatment Plans
- Validates diagnoses exist before allowing signing
- Updates client's active diagnosis list
- Tracks primary diagnosis and effective dates

### 3. New API Endpoints
**Routes**: `packages/backend/src/routes/clinicalNote.routes.ts`

1. `GET /clinical-notes/client/:clientId/eligible-appointments/:noteType`
2. `GET /clinical-notes/client/:clientId/inherited-diagnoses/:noteType`

---

## FRONTEND COMPONENTS - COMPLETE ✅

### 1. AppointmentPicker
**File**: `packages/frontend/src/components/ClinicalNotes/AppointmentPicker.tsx`

Beautiful UI showing:
- Eligible appointments with date/time/service code
- Status indicators
- "Create New" option when none exist
- Warnings for appointments with existing notes

### 2. ScheduleHeader
**File**: `packages/frontend/src/components/ClinicalNotes/ScheduleHeader.tsx`

Pinned header for all notes showing:
- Full session date and time
- Service code badge
- Location and participants
- Edit button with audit trail note

## REMAINING WORK ⏳

### Priority 1: CreateAppointmentModal
Modal to create new appointment when no eligible ones exist.
Pre-populates based on note type.

### Priority 2: Update All 8 Note Forms
Each form needs:
1. Appointment selection at start
2. ScheduleHeader at top
3. Auto-populate diagnoses (Progress/Treatment Plan)
4. Validation for appointment requirement

Forms to update:
- IntakeAssessmentForm.tsx
- ProgressNoteForm.tsx
- TreatmentPlanForm.tsx
- CancellationNoteForm.tsx
- ConsultationNoteForm.tsx
- ContactNoteForm.tsx
- TerminationNoteForm.tsx
- MiscellaneousNoteForm.tsx

### Priority 3: Database Constraint
Add unique constraint: one note per appointment per type

---

## ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS

1. **Appointment Required**: All clinical notes must link to appointments
2. **Diagnosis Inheritance**: Progress/Treatment Plan auto-populate from Intake
3. **One Note Per Appointment**: Default rule (configurable exceptions)
4. **Eligible Criteria**: Scheduled/Completed, past/present only, type matches
5. **Schedule Header**: Pinned at top with edit capability

---

## TESTING WHEN YOU RETURN

1. Refresh browser at localhost:5175
2. Navigate to Jessica Anderson → Clinical Notes
3. **Your saved notes should now appear!**
4. Backend running successfully on port 3001
5. Frontend at port 5175
