## üöß Blocked - Requires Action

### Issue: IAM Permission Problem

**The Problem:**
The AWS IAM user `mentalspace-chime-sdk` lacks the necessary ECR permissions to:
- Login to ECR (`ecr:GetAuthorizationToken`)
- Push Docker images (`ecr:PutImage`, `ecr:InitiateLayerUpload`, etc.)
- Describe repositories (`ecr:DescribeRepositories`)
- Describe ECS services (`ecs:DescribeServices`)

**What I Was Trying to Do:**
1. ‚úÖ Created ECR repository (successful via CDK)
2. ‚ùå Login to ECR to push Docker image (blocked by permissions)
3. ‚è∏Ô∏è  Build Docker image (waiting for login)
4. ‚è∏Ô∏è  Push image to ECR (waiting for login)
5. ‚è∏Ô∏è  Deploy Compute stack (waiting for image)

---

## Two Options to Fix

### Option 1: Grant ECR/ECS Permissions to Current User (Recommended)

Add this IAM policy to the `mentalspace-chime-sdk` user:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken",
        "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability",
        "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
        "ecr:GetRepositoryPolicy",
        "ecr:DescribeRepositories",
        "ecr:ListImages",
        "ecr:DescribeImages",
        "ecr:BatchGetImage",
        "ecr:InitiateLayerUpload",
        "ecr:UploadLayerPart",
        "ecr:CompleteLayerUpload",
        "ecr:PutImage"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ecs:DescribeServices",
        "ecs:DescribeTasks",
        "ecs:DescribeTaskDefinition",
        "ecs:UpdateService",
        "ecs:ListTasks"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**How to apply (AWS Console):**
1. Go to IAM ‚Üí Users ‚Üí `mentalspace-chime-sdk`
2. Click "Add permissions" ‚Üí "Attach policies directly"
3. Click "Create policy" and paste the JSON above
4. Name it `MentalSpaceECRDeployment`
5. Attach to the user

**How to apply (AWS CLI):**
```bash
# Create the policy
aws iam create-policy \
  --policy-name MentalSpaceECRDeployment \
  --policy-document file://ecr-policy.json

# Attach to user
aws iam attach-user-policy \
  --user-name mentalspace-chime-sdk \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::706704660887:policy/MentalSpaceECRDeployment
```

### Option 2: Use Different AWS Credentials

If you have admin credentials or another IAM user with ECR permissions, I can use those instead. Just provide:
- AWS Access Key ID
- AWS Secret Access Key
- Region (us-east-1)

---

## Next Steps After Permission Fix

Once ECR permissions are granted, I will immediately:

1. **Login to ECR** (5 seconds)
   ```bash
   aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | \
     docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 706704660887.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
   ```

2. **Build Docker Image** (~5-8 minutes)
   ```bash
   docker build -t mentalspace-backend:latest packages/backend/
   docker tag mentalspace-backend:latest 706704660887.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/mentalspace-ehr-backend-dev:latest
   ```

3. **Push to ECR** (~2-3 minutes)
   ```bash
   docker push 706704660887.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/mentalspace-ehr-backend-dev:latest
   ```

4. **Deploy Compute Stack** (~3-5 minutes)
   ```bash
   cd infrastructure
   npx cdk deploy MentalSpace-Compute-dev -c environment=dev --require-approval never
   ```

5. **Run Database Migrations** (~1 minute)
   ```bash
   # Get database URL from Secrets Manager
   # Run: npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

6. **Deploy Monitoring Stack** (~2 minutes)
   ```bash
   npx cdk deploy MentalSpace-Monitoring-dev -c environment=dev --require-approval never
   ```

7. **Verify Application** (~30 seconds)
   ```bash
   curl http://mentalspace-ehr-dev-881286108.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/api/v1/health
   ```

**Total Time After Permission Fix: ~15-20 minutes**

## Summary

**What's Working:**
- 85% of infrastructure is deployed and ready
- VPC networking is complete
- Database is running and accessible
- Load balancer is configured
- ECR repository is created
- No resources are wasting money (Compute stack hasn't started)

**What's Blocked:**
- Docker image build and push (ECR permission needed)
- ECS service deployment (needs Docker image first)
- Application deployment (needs ECS service)

**Required from You:**
- Grant ECR/ECS permissions to `mentalspace-chime-sdk` IAM user
- OR provide different AWS credentials with these permissions

**I'm Ready:**
- As soon as permissions are granted, I can complete the remaining 15% in 15-20 minutes
- All code is written and tested
- All infrastructure definitions are ready
- Just need the permission to push Docker images

## Cost Status

**Currently Running (per hour):**
- NAT Gateway: $0.045/hour
- RDS PostgreSQL (t3.micro): $0.017/hour
- Load Balancer: $0.0225/hour
- **Total: $0.0845/hour** (~$62/month)

**After Full Deployment:**
- Add ECS Fargate (1 task): $0.02/hour
- **Total: $0.1045/hour** (~$77/month)

No compute resources are running yet, so costs are minimal!
