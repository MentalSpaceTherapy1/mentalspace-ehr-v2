  - Use auto-scaling for compute resources
  - Monitor performance metrics continuously

#### 4. Data Migration Challenges
- **Risk:** Data from legacy system may not map cleanly
- **Impact:** High (data integrity, business continuity)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start data mapping analysis early
  - Create comprehensive data transformation scripts
  - Test migration on subset of data first
  - Perform data reconciliation
  - Have rollback plan if migration fails

#### 5. User Adoption Resistance
- **Risk:** Staff may resist learning new system
- **Impact:** Medium (productivity, user satisfaction)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Involve key users in UAT and feedback
  - Provide comprehensive training
  - Identify and empower champions
  - Offer ongoing support
  - Highlight benefits and quick wins

#### 6. Security Vulnerabilities
- **Risk:** Security flaw could lead to data breach
- **Impact:** Critical (HIPAA violation, reputation, legal)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Conduct regular security audits
  - Hire external penetration testers (Week 35)
  - Implement security best practices (OWASP)
  - Use AWS security services (GuardDuty, Shield, WAF)
  - Have incident response plan ready

#### 7. Third-Party Service Outages
- **Risk:** AWS, Stripe, AdvancedMD outages could impact system
- **Impact:** Medium to High (business continuity)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Design for graceful degradation
  - Implement retry logic and queues
  - Have status page for users
  - Maintain manual backup processes for critical workflows
  - Consider multi-region for critical services (Phase 11+)
