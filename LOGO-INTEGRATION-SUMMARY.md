# Logo Integration Summary

## ✅ Changes Made

I've integrated your MentalSpace Therapy logo into the application in all the key places:

### 1. **Login Page** (`packages/frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx`)
- Logo displays at the top center (large, 24h/6rem height)
- Replaces the text "MentalSpace EHR" header
- Graceful fallback to text if logo file is missing

### 2. **Sidebar Navigation** (`packages/frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx`)
- Logo appears at the top of the sidebar
- Size: 16h/4rem height
- Visible on all authenticated pages

### 3. **Browser Tab/Favicon** (`packages/frontend/index.html`)
- Logo set as the favicon (browser tab icon)
- Updated page title to "MentalSpace Therapy - EHR"
- Added meta description

## 📁 Next Step: Add Your Logo File

**To complete the integration, you need to:**

1. Save your logo image (the one you shared with blue "Mental" and green "Space") as:
   ```
   packages/frontend/public/logo.png
   ```

2. **File requirements:**
   - Filename must be exactly: `logo.png`
   - Format: PNG (transparent background recommended)
   - Recommended size: 400x150 pixels or similar aspect ratio

## 🔄 After Adding the Logo

Once you place the `logo.png` file in the `packages/frontend/public/` directory, I'll need to:

1. ✅ Rebuild the frontend
2. ✅ Deploy updated frontend to S3
3. ✅ Clear browser cache to see changes

## 🎨 Where the Logo Appears

1. **Login page** - Top center, welcoming users
2. **Sidebar header** - Persistent branding on every page
3. **Browser favicon** - Tab icon for easy identification
4. **All authenticated pages** - Consistent brand presence

## 💡 Fallback Behavior

If the logo file is not found, the application gracefully falls back to displaying "MentalSpace" text, so the application won't break.

## 🎯 Current Status

- ✅ Code updated in 3 files
- ✅ Fallback handling implemented
- ⏳ **Logo file needs to be placed** in `packages/frontend/public/`
- ⏳ Frontend needs rebuild and redeployment

**Note:** I'm currently rebuilding the backend to add the missing productivity endpoints. Once that's done and you've added the logo file, I'll rebuild and redeploy the frontend with your branding!
