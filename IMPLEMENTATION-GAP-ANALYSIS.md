## ✅ SUMMARY

**What's Working:**
- Full authentication system (EHR + Portal)
- Complete client management
- Full appointment scheduling
- Clinical documentation workflow
- Basic billing and payments
- Client portal UI (45+ pages fully built)

**What's Partially Done:**
- Client portal backend (60% - UI done, APIs partially complete)
- AdvancedMD integration (30% - framework built, not connected)
- Productivity tracking (70% - UI done, calculations pending)
- Telehealth (40% - consent done, video pending)

**What's Not Started:**
- Reporting & Analytics (0%)
- Client portal engagement features (0%)

**Critical Blockers:**
1. **Intake forms database** - Dropdown empty, blocking form assignment testing
2. **Messages backend** - Fully built UI with no backend
3. **AdvancedMD connection** - No integration testing yet

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Populate intake forms (immediate - 1 hour)
2. Complete Messages backend (1-2 days)
3. Complete Assessments backend (2-3 days)
4. Test full client portal journey (1 day)
5. Begin AdvancedMD integration (2 weeks)
